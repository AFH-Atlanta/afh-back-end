# afh-back-end
Back end for the AFH project


## Notes from November 29th
We decided to go forth with a .NET backend. Our goals include:

* Make a data model
* Create an API for the front end to interact with
* Organize the data to be easily consumable for the B user, i.e. the gov't agent trying to access the data
